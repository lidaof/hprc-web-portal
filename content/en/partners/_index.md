### [Coriell Institute](https://www.coriell.org/)

Many of the samples used in the reference genome are made available to researchers through the Coriell Institute.

### [Genome Reference Consortium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc)

Genome Reference Consortium helps to put nucleotide sequences into chromosome context for many different genomes.

### Google

The team at Google develops [variant detection methods for calling with pangenomes](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) and for error correction of assemblies. Google has also developed [sequence data correction methods that improve the output of sequencing instruments](https://github.com/google/deepconsensus). Google is working with HPRC members to apply that technology to HPRC sequencing data and assemblies.

### [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)

The HPRC is committed to GA4GH principles which include a framework for responsible sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data, and the associated work streams that are founded on this framework. Learn more about GA4GH and how to become a contributor to the GA4GH community.

The HPRC is a member of the [Human Pangenome Project](https://humanpangenomeproject.org/), which is a [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/our-community/driver-projects/) Driver Project.
