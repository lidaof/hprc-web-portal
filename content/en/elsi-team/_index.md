#### Heather Lawson, PhD

Dr. Lawson received her PhD in Molecular Anthropology from The Pennsylvania State University under the mentorship of Dr Kenneth Weiss. She went on to do a postdoc at Washington University with Dr James Cheverud, where her research focused on identifying parent-of-origin effects associated with variation in complex traits. She accepted a faculty position in the Genetics Department at Washington University in 2015, where she continued to study the molecular mechanisms underlying parent-of-origin effects. Over the course of her research, she became more and more interested in ELSI issues, particularly issues of data sovereignty and informed consent. She is also interested in scientific outreach and the dissemination of science to the general public. She joined the HPRC as a part of the Coordination Center at Washington University. She leads the consortium's Outreach and is a champion of the international Human Pangenome Project, which is a GA4GH Driver Project. Her work with the HPRC ELSI Team is focused on data sovereignty and harmonizing consent documents for pangenome reference resource studies.

#### Joseph Yracheta, MS

Joseph Yracheta is an Amerindigenous Scientist (P’urhepecha y Raramuri from Mexico) at the Native BioData Consortium, which exists within the Cheyenne River Lakota Nation (Sioux) of South Dakota.  Mr. Yracheta has been a scientist since 1990, when he started as a bench biotechnician and worked across many biomedical disciplines. In 2014, he graduated from the UW-Seattle with a master’s of Pharmaceutics and Bioethics under Drs. Ken Thummel and Wylie Burke. He is currently finishing a DrPH in Environmental Health and Engineering from Johns Hopkins under Drs. Ana Navas-Acien and Paul Locke. Mr. Yracheta is passionately working to achieve Indigenous Data Sovereignty by "wearing many research hats" of law, ethics, policy, genomics, omics, health outcomes, epidemiology, health care prevention/intervention, and amelioration from systemic racism. Mr. Yracheta believes that ALL data and resources must be seen as unforeseen futures, where their value will constantly change. He feels this data must be secured for Indigenous economic and cultural sustainability.
