{{< intro >}}
The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) is a project funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute to sequence and assemble genomes from individuals from diverse populations in order to better represent the genomic landscape of diverse human populations.

### We Need More Than One Human Reference Genome

No single genome can represent the diversity in the human population. Using a single reference genome creates reference biases, adversely affecting variant discovery, geneâ€“disease association studies and the accuracy of genetic analyses.

The HPRC was started to help migrate common genomic analysis to use a pangenome so diverse populations are better represented.
