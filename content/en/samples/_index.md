## Population Sampling and Representation

<div class="release">

{{< img src="popsampbanner.png" >}}

A comprehensive collection of diverse and highly accurate human reference genomes is critical to a complete understanding of human genetics. Samples in this project will be selected to improve the representation of human genetic variation, which will provide a richer and more complete human genomic reference resource. A richer human reference will improve our ability to predict, diagnose and treat disease.

### Initial Sampling Effort

The first 200 samples included in the project will be from the 1000 genomes (1KG) collection at Coriell. Selection of the 1KG lines will be prioritized based upon samplesâ€™ ability to cover genetic and geographic variation, availability of low passage cell lines to avoid artifacts that may arise during extensive cell culture, and a subset will be prioritized due to the availability of trios/parental data to assist in the technical challenges of phased assembly release.

### Future Sampling

References generated from 1KG lines alone are insufficient to capture the extent of sequence variation among humans. To ensure that we are able to maximize our surveys of sample variation, we will broaden our efforts to recruit new participants into this study, and establish a consent and open access data release along with cell-based resources.
