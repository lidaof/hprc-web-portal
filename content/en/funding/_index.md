## Funding

For {{< bluespan >}}**Phase 2**{{< /bluespan >}} of the [Human Genome Reference Program](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Human-Genome-Reference-Program), three components were funded. They are collectively called the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC).  These include:

1. A Human Genome Reference Center (HGRC; [**RFA-HG-23-025**](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-23-025.html))  
2. High Quality Human Reference Genomes (HGRQ; [**RFA-HG-23-024**](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-23-024.html))  
3. Informatics tools for use of the human genome reference (ITPG; [**RFA-HG-25-007**](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-25-007.html))
