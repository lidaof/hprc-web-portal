## Funding

{{< purple >}}
The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is funding multiple components to improve and update the Human Genome Reference Program. These funding resources include the following: A Human Genome Reference Center (HGRC; RFA-HG-19-004), High Quality Human Reference Genomes (HGRQ; RFA-HG-19-002), Genome Reference Representations (GRR; RFA-HG-19-003), Informatics tools for use of the human genome reference (see Concept documents), Technology development for complete sequencing of genomes (NOT-HG-19-011).

### The Human Pangenome Reference Center

The Human Pangenome Reference Center (HPRC) at Washington University will serve as the coordinating center for the projects. Dr. Ting Wang will lead the HPRC, and other PIs include Dr. Ira Hall, Yale University, Dr. Benedict Paten, University of California, Santa Cruz, and Dr. Fergal Martin, EMBL-EBI. The HPRC will provide the infrastructure necessary to coordinate this large-scale effort. This work will facilitate communications within the HGRP, among international genome reference collaborators, and with the scientific and medical communities.

### The High-Quality Reference Genome

The High-Quality Reference Genome (HQRG) effort is led by Dr. Karen Miga at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and other PIs include Dr. Ting Wang, Washington University, Dr. Evan Eichler, University of Washington, Dr. Erich Jarvis, The Rockefeller University, Dr. Ira Hall, Washington University, and Dr. Eimear Kenny, Icahn School of Medicine. The HQRG aims to create a genome reference representative of human genetic diversity. Standard metrics for high-quality genome assemblies will be established, and haplotype-resolved human genomes will be produced. The program will work collaboratively to select and prioritize diverse samples consented for full data release. The HGRQ will also resolve reported errors in the genome assemblies.

### Genome Reference Representations (GRRs)

The Genome Reference Representations (GRR) projects support research and development for a next-generation genome reference representation that can capture all human genome variation and support research on the full diversity of populations.
