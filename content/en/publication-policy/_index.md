## Publication Policy

**Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Publication Policy**

**General Guidelines for Publications**

Please refer to the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium [Data Use: Best Practices](/data-use/).

If publishing a research finding that has utilized the Pangenome Reference, the HPRC expects users to include the relevant HPRC attribution statement (see below). In addition, publications arising from such research must not contain the personal data of any participant (see Definitions). Such publications should not contain information that could reasonably be expected to cause a participant, their families, their communities, or members of specific populations to experience harm or stigmatization.

**For HPRC member users**: The recommended (internal) attribution statement:

_“We would like to acknowledge the National Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) for funding the following grants supporting the creation of the human pangenome reference: U41HG010972, U01HG010971, U01HG013760, U01HG013755, U01HG013748, U01HG013744, R01HG011274, and the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (BioProject ID: PRJNA730823).”_

**For other users:** The recommended (external) attribution statement:

_“We would like to acknowledge the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (BioProject ID: PRJNA730823) and its funder, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).”_

This document will be updated to include the marker publication associated with HPRC Release II when it becomes available.

Any publication must comply with the [NIH Public Access Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/public-access-policy). Authors should try to publish their work using open-access approaches, acknowledging that sometimes unfettered open access is not accepted, e.g., when working with Indigenous datasets and local communities with sovereign rights.

**Preprints** of submitted manuscripts must be shared via an appropriate preprint server before or concurrently with the journal submission.

- Preprints are considered publications and should be cited like papers.

**Authorship and Banner Publications**

- The HPRC Steering Committee will work with authors to decide when and whom to credit.

**Resolution of Disagreements**

- If questions or disagreements arise between investigators, they should resolve them together. Investigators may petition the HPRC Steering Committee to help resolve the situation if a mutually agreeable solution cannot be attained. The decision of the Steering Committee will be final, and all parties must abide by their decision.

**Definitions:**

**Pangenome Reference:** these are the data resources produced by the HPRC and include raw sequence data, individual genome assemblies, sequence alignments, and annotations.

**Users:** Any individual, institution or entity using the Pangenome Reference, including both commercial and non-commercial use.

**Participant**: Any individual whose data are included in the Pangenome Reference.
